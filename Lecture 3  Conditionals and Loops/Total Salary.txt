Total Salary

Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
   
 totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf

where :

hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.

Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Note: Try finding out a function on the internet to do so

Input format :
Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)

Output Format :
Total Salary

Constraints :
0 <= Basic Salary <= 7,500,000

Sample Input 1 :
10000 A

Sample Output 1 :
17600

Sample Input 2 :
4567 B

Sample Output 2 :
8762
